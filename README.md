### COVID19_Dataset_Clustering
1. Estimate a parametric model that describes the trend of COVID-19 in each state. 
2. Use hierarchical clustering with single and complete linkages to cluster the states into k = 5 clusters based on their parameter values.
3. Use k-means clustering to cluster the states into k = 5 clusters based on their parameter values. Compute final the cluster centers and the total distortion.
